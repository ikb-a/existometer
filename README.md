# Existometer

This is an implementation of a `ci`, which uses the [ci framework](https://github.com/mystor/ci)
to implement the goal of determining whether a person exists or not.  It uses various sources to do
so.

## Requirements
- This is a maven project.
- Existometer requires Java 8+
- To use Bing search results, the Bing API Key must be in the environment variable BING_KEY
- To use Google geocoding, the Google Geocoding API Key must be in the environment variable GOOGLE_KEY

## Usage
Run the main function, enter name, email, etc. and observe the results

## Existometer Demo
Earlier in the summer, I made a GUI demo of the basic existometer concept. This can be found on the 
`old` branch of this repository.
